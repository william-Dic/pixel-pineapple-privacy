# Privacy Policy for Pixel Pineapple

**Last Updated:** September 24, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Pixel Pineapple Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and shares information in its operation. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with care.

### 1. Data We Collect and How We Use It

The Extension is designed to perform its core function with minimal data collection. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users.

The only types of information the Extension processes are:

* **User-Uploaded Images:** When you upload a product image to the Extension, this image data is transmitted to the Google Gemini AI API for the sole purpose of generating a marketing website. This data is processed in real-time and is **not stored** by us.
* **Google Gemini API Key:** The user’s API key is stored **locally** on your computer within your Chrome browser's storage using the `chrome.storage` API. This allows you to use the Extension without having to re-enter your key each time. This key is **never** transmitted to our servers or any third parties other than Google's own API endpoint.

### 2. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or trade any user data to third parties.

The only instance of data sharing is the necessary transmission of the user-uploaded image to the **Google Gemini AI API (`aistudio.google.com`)**. This is done securely via HTTPS and is essential for the Extension's core functionality—generating marketing content and websites.

### 3. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your data. All data transmissions between your browser and the Google Gemini API are secured using **HTTPS encryption**. Since we do not store any user data on our servers, the risk of a data breach is significantly minimized. The Google Gemini API key is stored locally and securely within your browser's storage, which is a secure and standard practice for Chrome extensions.

### 4. Children's Privacy

The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
